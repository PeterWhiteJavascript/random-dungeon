                                                    The player finally reaches his 18th birthday, which means he's ready to go out into the world and work.
                                                    His grandfather agrees to purchase a farm somewhere and the player gets to choose what type of farm it is.
                                                    The player is given three options for world generation based on what activity they'd prefer.
                                                    The activities are Mining, Farming, and Cooking.

                                                    The player then travels to a bazaar type event with his grandfather where he can purchase certain things from all of the shops there.
                                                    The player's grandfather gives him 30000 coins to purchase items.
                                                    This starting scene is scripted and all of the available items are set.
                                                    Once the player is ready to travel to the farm he bought, he just needs to talk to his grandfather who is waiting at the bazaar entrance.
                                                </p>

                                                    After that, the game is won.

                                        Worlds (sometimes referred to as maps) in this game consists of randomly generated maps that have progression based on what is generated.
                                        For example: a map that has a dungeon on it may have some kind of story arc to do with the dungeon.

                                        Chunks are pieces of the randomly generated map (world). 
                                        They consist of tiles, objects, and interiors, as well as many other custom properties. 
                                        There are many different types of chunks as well as two different ways of generating them.

                                        The player can travel to different maps by buying a different farm.
                                        Each map has one farm on it (the one that you buy).
                                        When acquiring a farm, the player gets a "map" item that can be viewed from the menu that gives an overview of what has been explored in the world.
                                        Maps (the item) start out blank and are filled out as the player explores the world.

                                                    The main map, which is displayed when the player travels to a farm, contains information about the tiles and objects that are displayed, as well as other information about the world.
                                                    Other maps are simply the interiors of structures.
                                                    Maps consist of two tile layers that contain the terrain, and one object layer that contains all objects that have a physical location on the map.

                                                                For example, when the map is generated, the info property stores how many lakes there are, as well as if there is an island on any of there lakes, as well as if there are any dungeons on any of the islands.
                                                                There is an NPC that talks about the lakes so that you don't actually have to explore them to know certain things about them.

                                                    Chunks can be generated by selecting from a list of pre-made chunks, or by creating the tiles from a set of instructions.

                                                    Premade chunks are usually smaller so that they blend in with the main map better. 
                                                    Exceptions to this are <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="town">towns</a> and <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="farm">farms</a>. 
                                                    Players may end up seeing the same town generated in different maps, but the objects inside the town will likely be different (different <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="shops">shops</a>, etc...).

                                                    Random chunks are what make each map really unique. 
                                                    They can be randomly generated <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="lake">lakes</a>, <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="river">rivers</a>, <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="dungeon">dungeons</a>, and more. 
                                                    Since the shape, objects that spawn, and even <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="interior">interiors</a> are different in each map, the player should always have something new to explore.

                                                                If there are multiple of the same loc set for spawnObjects, the first one that is spawned is kept. 
                                                                This allows for sometimes spawning rarer items on the same tile if an earlier spawnObject chance fails.

                                                        They can be houses, dungeons, shops, or the farm.

                                                        The farm is where the player spawns when traveling to a world. 
                                                        Depending on the type of world, the exterior could feature large plots of land, a cave, a garden, a pond for raising fish, weeds spawns, mushroom logs, a barn, etc.. 
                                                        The interior could feature a kitchen, different processing machines (milk -> butter, eggs -> mayonaise, etc...), a hot tub (for replenishing energy midday), etc...
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        If the farm comes with a barn, there can be different animals that can be bought for it in the town. 
                                                        Caring for animals is simplified in that they don't have any sort of affection level and the quality of produce is determined by the character's proficiency. 
                                                        To milk cows, you just need empty bottles, which can be found by digging, be bought in stores, or recycled from using an item stored in a bottle.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The farm chunk connects to most other chunks that are generated. 
                                                        It does not connect to the town as the town has some mutual connections with the farm. 
                                                        This means that instead of a straight path from the farm to the town, it will go farm -> forest <- town, and farm -> river <- town.
                                                    </p>

                                                        Contains a house that can be added to randomly generated chunks such as forests and lakes. 
                                                        This house selects from a different list than what is found in town. 
                                                        These houses tend to be less important, but still pretty cool. 
                                                        Examples could be hiring certain characters, oracle that reveals certain information about the map, taste tester that will buy one cooked item off of you each day and give feedback based on how it tastes, etc...

                                                        Contains a randomized dungeon. 
                                                        The top and bottom floors are not random. 
                                                        The top floor contains a set of stairs going down into the random part, as well as a sign that displays some information about the dungeon such as deepest floor reached, 
                                                        treasure at bottom taken, rocks smashed, ore mined, tiles dug, items found in ground, total floors traveled, etc...

                                                        There are different depths and treasure grids based on the level of the dungeon, which is based on the level of the world.

                                                        Something like you encounter a witch that can cast a spell to send you down 5 floors, you find a group that wants to fight, you find a healing spring that heals your party a bit, etc...

                                                        The bottom floor always contains at least one treasure chest for the taking. 
                                                        Sometimes there is a boss at the bottom that you have to fight on higher level dungeons.

                                                    There are three types of main maps: Mining, Farming, and Cooking; each with a different focus for making money.
                                                    To go to another map, the player has to buy a farm on it from the farm shop.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Each map type has base chunks and has more added in higher level maps.
                                                    Different worlds have different activities that should be focused on to maximize profits.
                                                    For example, a mining world has little farmland, but many dungeons, so having a crafting room and exploring mines is better than trying to farm.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    All worlds have some areas to collect forage items.
                                                    If the player completely runs out of money and they lose their tools somehow, they should be able to make money from doing forage tasks or part-time jobs.
                                                    The game shouldn't be able to be soft-locked by not having any money.

                                                    The mining world contains multiple dungeons that can be explored.
                                                    Since monsters can be found in dungeons, it is necessary to have a <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="blacksmith">blacksmith</a> shop where the player can buy weapons and armour.
                                                    The main sources of income are battling, selling ores, and selling crafted items.

                                                    The shop also sells fertilizer.
                                                    The main source of income is selling produce in the <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="farmers-market">farmer's market</a>.

                                                    There is a <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="food-kiosk">food kiosk</a> in town where people can register to have food ready by a certain time.

                                                    Goals include winning a festival, taking the treasure at the bottom of a dungeon, clearing a certain number of enemies, defeating a boss enemy, selling a certain number of dishes in a restaurant, selling a certain number of crops at the farmer's market, catching a certain rare fish, etc...

                                                            It can also be used to smash ore rocks in the dungeon.

                                                            It can be filled in any body of fresh water.
                                                            There is usually a water filling station on the farm.

                                                            It can be used when there is a fish animation on water. 
                                                            It only casts at 1 range, so the player must have a raft to get deeper fish.
                                                            Damage and Speed affect the fishing minigame.

                                                            The player can pick up items and fish while on it.

                                                            Since it is a tool, it is carried around in the bag just like a regular item.

                                                    When forage items are picked up for the first time, their quality is generated base on the character that picked it up.

                                                    If there is space in front of the player, a stack of items can be placed on the ground from the menu as well.
                                                    This is the only way to place a stack of items as throwing an item only places one of the item.

                                                    Items cannot be thrown on tiles around the outside edge of the map, as if the map has space to go offscreen, that's where the doorway is.
                                                    Any items that have been thrown stay there on any map that is saved until they are picked up again.
                                                    This means that any items thrown on the ground in a random dungeon are lost if the player leaves the room.

                                                    These are mainly acquired by buying them in a shop or using the seed make to produce them.

                                                    An item's quality affects its value.
                                                    At maximum quality (10), a item is worth double its base value.
                                                    The formula for calculating an item's value is:

                                                    Item quality is set when an item is acquired for the first time. Normal shops always sell the lowest quality items.

                                    Characters have different stats which the game checks against to see how well a character performs a certain action.

                                                    Energy is depleted when doing an action with a tool. 
                                                    Once the energy bar is completely empty, the character's health gets depleted at twice the rate for the same actions. 
                                                    Once the character runs out of health, they black out and wake up at the farm the next day with very little energy and health restored.
                                                    Health is also what is depleted when an enemy attacks the character.
                                                    If a character still has stamina when their heath bar reaches zero, they still black out.

                                                    To level up, they need to get a certain number of EXP. Points from winning battles.
                                                    Stats can also increase from reaching specific tool proficiencies.
                                                    For example, at level 3 Axe, the character gets +1 Strength.

                                                    These stats are improved by increasing the <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="proficiency">proficiency</a> of the corresponding tool or action.

                                                    If the character's consistency is equal to or greater than the quality, the item will be generated with the maximum quality.

                                                    This value improves as they use the tool.

                                    Farming is a valuable source of raw materials for cooking, income, as well as health and energy restoration items.
                                    To grow crops, the player need access to a hoe, watering can, seeds, and available soil.
                                    To care for livestock, a barn or chicken coop, animals, and animal feed is required.
                                    Livestock can be butchered for meat, though meat can also be bought from a butcher.

                                                    Seeds are always low quality.
                                                    This is the best way to obtain a lot of seeds to grow crops where the quality doesn't matter as much.

                                                    Seeds vary in quality depending on the rank of the request. 
                                                    This is the only way to obtain certain seeds early on.

                                                <p>
                                                    3. Produce by putting a crop in the seed maker. 
                                                    Seeds quality is based on the crop quality. 
                                                    The seed maker is not available until the player owns a pretty expensive farm.

                                                    Seeds quality is based on the character's shovel rank.
                                                    The seeds that can be dug are the ones sold in the shop.

                                                <p>
                                                    To plant seeds, the player must use them on tilled soil.
                                                    Crops have a 25% chance of withering every day after they have not been watered for 3 days straight.
                                                    This prevents players from continuing to increase a crop's quality with fertilizer while not advancing the crop.

                                                    Crops can be fertilized once per day, which increases their quality by 0.25.
                                                    Fertilizer can be crafted with weeds or can be bought in a shop.

                                                    When a crop is done growing, the player can interact with it while not holding anything to pick it. 
                                                    For simplicity, all crops are harvested this way.

                                                    There is a small chance of increasing the crop's quality depending on the character that is harvesting it. 
                                                    This chance is increased depending on how high the character's special <a class="action-link" data-keyword-anchor="char-stat-crop-quality">cropQuality</a> stat is.

                                                    All farms have space for a barn and chicken coop.
                                                    The number of upgrades possible is based on the world level.
                                                    When a farm is being built, there is an option to include certain facilities at a discounted rate.
                                                    Both barns and chicken coops can be build at a later time if they are not built right away.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Animals require one piece of food each day to stay alive, which is dispensed automatically if there is food in the food dispenser.
                                                    Chickens require chicken feed, whereas larger animals require animal feed.
                                                    To collect eggs, they just need to be picked up.
                                                    To milk cows, a milker must be used.
                                                    To collect wool from sheep, shears must be used.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Here is a list of Animal Facilities.
                                                    The cost for upgraded facilities is the upgrade cost, meaning that to build a Large Barn would require 45000 + 300 Lumber.

                                    Fishing is a great way to gain energy restoring items while away from the farm.
                                    Fish can be sold in a fish market, used as in dishes, or eaten raw.
                                    Fish are more active at different times of the day, and an animated sprite appears on a tile where a fish inhabits.

                                                    To fish, the player needs a fishing rod.
                                                    Better quality rods can cast further and catch better fish.

                                                    Fish appear in rivers, lakes, and oceans and have higher frequency at different times.
                                                    There is an animation when a fish is on a tile, so the player can know where to cast their line.
                                                </p>

                                                    There is a minigame event for catching fish where the player needs to line up a swaying bar within a box.
                                                    Each time the player presses interact while to line is swaying gives a certain number of points based on how close it is to the center.
                                                    If the number of points is greater than the number required to catch the fish, it is caught.
                                                    If the number of points is less than required, there is a chance that the fish gets away.
                                                    If the fish does not get away, the player has another chance to try to catch the fish.
                                                    The points are cumulative.
                                                    There is no time limit for each tug.

                                                    A lower rarity means there is a lower chance of encountering this particular fish.
                                                    Though there are many types of fish to catch, they are organized by group when put into the bag.

                                                    Water temperature is based on air temperature in the game.
                                                    Something like for ever 1 degree of air temperature, add 0.75 degrees of water temperature.
                                                    The closer to the middle of the range, the higher their chance of spawning is.

                                    Mining is one of the three main tasks in (farmgame).
                                    To mine, the player must enter a dungeon and smash rocks with the hammer.
                                    The player can also dig the ground in dungeons with the shovel to reveal items.
                                    In dungeons, random battles happen where the player can gain money from winning battles.

                                                    The top and bottom floors are not randomized.

                                                    To fight enemies, it is important to have equipment such as a sword and shield.

                                                    Since mining takes a lot of energy, it is important to have lots of restoration items.
                                                    Luckily, ores can be exchanged for prizes outside of the dungeon and some of the prizes are restoration items.
                                                    The main purpose of ores are to exchange for prizes.
                                                    In mining worlds, the main source of income is battling, since ores cannot be easily sold.

                                        Cooking is another very important task in (farmgame).
                                        Not only is it a great way to increase the value of items, it is necessary to gain large quantities of healing items.
                                        Cooking takes place either in the farm of in a restaurant and requires ingredients, kitchenware, and time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While cooking, there is a timer that counts up that has to do with how long it is taking to complete the current dish.
                                        Time passes at 1/6th of real time while cooking compared to the 1/60th normally.
                                        Once a dish has been completed for the first time, you can auto-cook which cooks one of what was made in the same time.
                                        This means that the player only has to manually cook dishes for the first time, though doing it multiple times to get faster times is a good idea.
                                        If cooking from a restaurant, all dishes are made manually.

                                                    The kitchen is a separate scene inside the farm and restaurant that allows the player to convert items into cooked dishes.
                                                    To enter the kitchen, the player must interact with a door, which leads them there.

                                                    Cooking takes time, so some days may be taken up just by making large batches of dishes.
                                                    Dishes generally restore a lot of energy and health and also tend to increase the value to higher that of the components combined.

                                                    Once the player selects the dish, they can select "manual" or "auto".
                                                    If the player selects "manual", they will create the dish through gameplay.

                                                    Selecting "auto" is the only way to create dishes in bulk.
                                                    The player must have the necessary tools as well as items in the ingredients box to select a recipe.

                                                    Any leftover prepared ingredients are considered items and can be interacted with normally.

                                                    If a farm does not have a kitchen, one can be bought from a store.

                                                    There are 4 different main types of dishes that can all be broken down into flavours, textures, and groups.
                                                    All dishes can have one or more flavour, texture, or group.
                                                    Some recipes allow for additions, which can change the flavour and add value.
                                                    Additions are generally things like salt, spices, and oil.
                                                    When an addition is added an the flavour that is added already exists in the dish, add Super before the flavour (Super Sweet).

                                                    Sets are dishes that consist of two or more dishes.
                                                    These often increase the energy and health restoration to more that the individual parts, but lower the value.
                                                    In the restaurant, a set has a higher chance of selling, but will give a lower return than selling all of the parts individually.

                                                    A recipe must be acquired before making the set.
                                                    This is usually done by NPC's telling the player about a set.
                                                    This can also be done by eating the set at a restaurant.
                                                    After selling a certain number of individual items that would make up a set, you can sometimes learn the recipe.

                                                    You can either own a restaurant or work part-time in one.
                                                    Part-time work allows you to make money without providing your own ingredients.
                                                    Each time the player works part time at a restaurant, he is given a recipe that is on the menu as well as his wage.
                                                    As an owner, you make the menu as well as provide ingredients.
                                                    In order to open your own restaurant, there must be one helper as the cook or one helper as the server.
                                                    The player can do the other task, but obviously has to spend their day working at the restaurant.
                                                    If there are two helper, one cook and one server, there must still be enough ingredients in the ingredients box to make dishes.
                                                    The player needs to either drop off ingredients, or have a delivery helper do it.

                                                    There are two jobs in restaurants: Server, and Cook.

                                                    As a server, your job is to make recommendations to customers, bring them food, and clean tables.
                                                    As customers enter the restaurant, they will find a seat or wait in the waiting area if the restaurant is full.
                                                    Customers will have different icons that appear above them to show their status.
                                                    They can ask for a recommendation, order food, or want to pay.
                                                    If they ask for a recommendation, you will see a customer profile that includes what types of foods they like, how hungry they are, and how much money they are willing to spend.

                                                    The cook's job is to cook food and place the food in the area where the server picks it up.
                                                    When an order is placed, an icon appears with what is needed.
                                                    Since the menu is known, the player can start preparing ingredients based on what could be ordered.
                                                    What the player is paid is based on performance and wasting ingredients lowers pay.

                                                    The player can own a few different types of shops.
                                                    The amount of product that is sold is based on the popularity and population values of the town.

                                                    At the food kiosk, customers write their order at 8:00 and pick up their food at 16:00.
                                                    The number of customers that can place an order is based on the satisfaction rating.
                                                    Orders that get completed raise satisfaction, whereas orders that are missed lower it.
                                                    
                                                    People write their order down at 8:00 and pick it up at 16:00.
                                                    When food is ready, it needs to be delivered back to the kiosk.
                                                    Money is obtained by checking the cash box at the kiosk after 16:00.

                                                    The shop can also be closed if the player doesn't plan on using it.
                                                    It can be managed by a single delivery helper.

                                                    The farmer's market is only open on Saturdays from 10:00 - 14:00.
                                                    Once your stand is set up with the items you want to sell showing, you're free to walk around and purchase things from other stands.
                                                    If an item runs out, it may be replaced with something else.
                                                    At 14:00, all stands close and you can collect the money that you have made from the cash box at your stand.

                                                    The fishing derby is a festival that is held where the player competes to get the most points.
                                                    The derby starts at 6:00 and ends at 14:00.
                                                    Once the derby is over, there is a cooking contest that has the fish that you caught as the main ingredient.
                                                    At 14:00 the player is asked if the'd like to submit their catch.
                                                    If the player doesn't want to submit their catch, they don't get teleported.
                                                    If they visit the festival area before 19:00, they can still participate in the cooking contest.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The results for the derby is at 14:30 and the player is teleported to the festival area at 14:00 (Time skips half an hour) if they want to submit their catch.
                                                    The player is asked if they'd like to participate in the cooking contest.
                                                    If they say yes, they are given 4.5 hours to bring a fish-based dish.
                                                    The player is teleported to the front of their house.
                                                    The player must make their way back to town and enter the festival area before 19:00 with their dish.
                                                    If the player does not have a fish-based dish to give, the festival will proceed as if the player did not want to bring a dish in the first place.

                                                    Points are awarded based on the weight of fish, their rarity, and the number of fish caught.
                                                    There are prizes awarded for first, second, and third.
                                                    The player can fish anywhere.
                                                    If the player participates in the cooking contest, they have a chance to win more prizes.
